📊 Sentiment Analysis Model
This project focuses on analyzing customer review sentiments using NLP and Machine Learning techniques. Below is the step-by-step breakdown of the workflow.

🧩 Step 1: Importing Libraries and Dataset

Import Required Libraries:

pandas – Data manipulation
nltk – Tokenization, stemming, stopword removal
sklearn – Model training, evaluation
matplotlib, seaborn – Visualization
wordcloud – Word cloud generation
contractions, emoji, BeautifulSoup – Preprocessing utilities

Load Dataset:

data = pd.read_csv('Reviews.csv')
Columns: Review, Liked

🔍 Step 2: Data Exploration
View first and last few entries: data.head(), data.tail()

Data info: data.info(), data.describe()

Missing values: data.isnull().sum()

Duplicates: data.duplicated().sum()

Sentiment distribution: data['Liked'].value_counts()

📊 Step 3: Data Visualization
Bar Plot: Positive vs Negative sentiment counts

Word Cloud: Frequently used words

Frequency Plot: Specific sentiment words like good, bad

🧹 Step 4: Text Preprocessing
Convert to lowercase

Tokenization using nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize

Remove punctuation using regex

Remove stop words via nltk.corpus.stopwords

Stemming with PorterStemmer

Lemmatization with WordNetLemmatizer

Remove numbers/special characters

Expand contractions using contractions library

Convert emojis to text via emoji library

Remove HTML tags/links using BeautifulSoup

🔢 Step 5: Feature Extraction
Use TfidfVectorizer from sklearn to convert text to numerical features

🔀 Step 6: Splitting the Data
Split data: 80% training, 20% testing

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(...)
🤖 Step 7: Model Selection and Training
Use Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB) for classification

Train model:

python
Copy
Edit
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
📈 Step 8: Model Evaluation
Predict on test data: model.predict(X_test)

Evaluate with:

accuracy_score

classification_report (precision, recall, F1-score)

🧪 Step 9: Predict New Review
Define preprocess_review() function to handle new inputs

Vectorize and predict:

python
Copy
Edit
review_tfidf = vectorizer.transform([preprocessed_review])
prediction = model.predict(review_tfidf)
Output: Positive or Negative

✅ Step 10: Final Conclusion & Analysis
Evaluate model's usefulness and accuracy

Future Enhancements:

Try other models like Logistic Regression, SVM, or deep learning

Use larger or more diverse datasets for improvement

📝 Summary
This project demonstrates a complete sentiment analysis pipeline:

From raw text cleaning and preprocessing,

To vectorization and model training,

To evaluation and real-time sentiment prediction.

It offers practical applications in improving customer experience and feedback-driven decision-making.
